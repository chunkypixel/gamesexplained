# Arkanoid — agent history

Narrative of how the analysis went, including wrong turns, for the next
agent's benefit. This is the only file that narrates; `facts.md` and
`features.md` state current truth only.

## 5 October 2026: run on claude-opus-5-5, kit 0.0.60

**Orient.** The upload is a G64 of Imagine's disk. VICE's defaults loaded
it through the custom fast loader with nothing changed; at warp the
hand-over came about 76 s after autostart. Polling the program counter
every 0.2 s while it loaded showed the loader living in the stack page
(`$0130`-`$01D8`); a disassembly of that page during the load showed the
exit, `JMP $9400`, and a stopping checkpoint there gave `entry.vsf`.
`c1541 -read` then showed the main file, `arkaniod`, is the whole of
`$0400`-`$FFF9` exactly as it sits at the hand-over, so no unpacking
happens after the load.

**The start-up hides its path.** `$9400` and `$095A` are written with
undocumented `NOP`s, so the disassembler's flow trace stopped at once.
The code after `JSR $B9C3` at `$095D` (`LAX $F004`, `JMP $F000`) looks
like the continuation and never runs: `$B9C3` leaves by `JMP $F000`.

**Running the game in the kit's simulator found the code.** The
simulator (`kit/c64/machine.js`) started at `$9400` stalled in `$5F42`,
which waits for CIA 1's serial port to finish shifting a byte, a part of
the chip the simulator does not model. A hook at `$5F5C` that writes the
value VICE leaves in `$BA65` and resumes at `$5F83` got it past. Then
five scripted sessions (attract mode, a joystick game with random input,
two-player keyboard, mouse, paddles) executed 5,816 instruction addresses,
765 of them outside what the flow trace had found. Seeding the
disassembler with every one raised the code from 13.6 KB to 15.3 KB.
The input menu stalled the first script: fire on port 2 brings the menu
up from the title, and only fire on port 1 (after J) starts the game.

**Network.** Every page fetch was refused by the session's proxy (C64-
Wiki, Wikipedia, the Internet Archive and its Wayback Machine,
c64online); web search summaries were the only outside source.
